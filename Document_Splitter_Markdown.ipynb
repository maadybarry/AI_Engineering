Technically, this\\nisn’t correct. There is, in fact, a distinct\\ndifference between the two. And the reason\\nfor one often being used instead of the other\\nis the lack of a transparent understanding\\nof both.\\nSo, let’s clear this up, shall we?\\nFirst, we will start with analysis.\\nConsider the following…\\nYou have a huge dataset containing data of\\nvarious types. Instead of tackling the entire\\ndataset and running the risk of becoming overwhelmed,\\nyou separate it into easier to digest chunks\\nand study them individually and examine how\\nthey relate to other parts. And that’s analysis\\nin a nutshell.\\nOne important thing to remember, however,\\nis that you perform analyses on things that\\nhave already happened in the past. Such as\\nusing an analysis to explain how a story ended\\nthe way it did or how there was a decrease\\nin sales last summer.\\nAll this means that we do analyses to explain\\nhow and/or why something happened.\\nGreat!\\nNow, this leads us nicely on to the definition\\nof analytics.\\nAs you have probably guessed, analytics generally\\nrefers to the future. Instead of explaining\\npast events it explores potential future ones.\\nAnalytics is essentially the application of\\nlogical and computational reasoning to the\\ncomponent parts obtained in an analysis. And\\nin doing this you are looking for patterns\\nand exploring what you could do with them\\nin the future.\\nHere, analytics branches off into two areas:\\nqualitative analytics – this is using your\\nintuition and experience in conjunction with\\nthe analysis to plan your next business move.\\nAnd quantitative analytics – this is applying\\nformulas and algorithms to numbers you have\\ngathered from your analysis.\\nHere are a couple of examples.\\nSay, you are an owner of an online clothing\\nstore. You are ahead of the competition and\\nhave a great understanding of what your customer's\\nneeds and wants are. You’ve performed a\\nvery detailed analysis from women’s clothing\\narticles and feel sure about which fashion\\ntrends to follow. You may use this intuition\\nto decide on which styles of clothing to start\\nselling. This would be qualitative analytics.\\nBut you might not know when to introduce the\\nnew collection. In that case, relying on past\\nsales data and user experience data, you could\\npredict in which month it would be best to\\ndo that. This is an example of using quantitative\\nanalytics.\\nFantastic!\\nTo backtrack a little, you can combine these\\nareas with analyses also – you could perform\\nqualitative analysis – to explain how or\\nwhy a story ended the way it did. And you\\ncan perform quantitative analysis – working\\nwith past data to explain how sales decreased\\nlast summer.\\nPerfect!\\nNow that we have cleared up the differences\\nbetween analysis and analytics it shouldn’t\\nbe too difficult to see how terms such as\\n‘data analysis’, ‘data analytics’,\\n‘business analysis’ and ‘business analytics’\\ncan have their unique meanings too.\\nMore of this will be explained in the next\\nvideo which aims to simplify these, as well\\nas many more with a fantastic diagram.
